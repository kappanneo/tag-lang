# tag
the abstraction game

## aim
tag is supposed to be a way to define programming languages at any level in the abstraction layer from the harware to the very high level (abstract) stuff

if this goes the way i want it to, there should be only one good reason not to use tag to write a new programming language: not knowing about tag
